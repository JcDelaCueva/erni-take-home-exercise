## Specification
- Android Studio Dolphin 2021.3.1 Patch 1
- Language: Kotlin 1.7.20
- Minimum SDK: 21
- Target SDK: 33


## Libraries
* [Architecture][1] - Defines the boundaries between parts of the app and the responsibilities each part should have.
  * [Lifecycles][2] - Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.
  * [LiveData][3] - An observable data holder class.
  * [ViewModel][4] - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. 
* Third party
  * [Dagger Hilt][5] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection.
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][6] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
  * [Retrofit][7] - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
  * [Glide][8] - A fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
